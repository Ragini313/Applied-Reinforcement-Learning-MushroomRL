# Assignment 1 - Stairway to Heaven
This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing various RL algorithms to solve the "Stairway to Heaven" grid-world environment using the MushroomRL library.

## üèóÔ∏è Environment
The "Stairway to Heaven" environment features:
- Agent that can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
- Lava river that gives penalties when touched
- Button that builds a stairway to heaven (3% collapse probability)
- 5% action failure probability
- Rewards:
  - +1.0 for reaching heaven
  - -0.1 for hitting lava
  - -0.01 for other transitions
